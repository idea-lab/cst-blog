We will summarize what we have learned so far by creating tetris in processing. Below is the code after Friday's meeting. Some of the logic changed and the 'spawn' function and arrays were implemnted. 
Make sure you try implementing those yourself before copy-pasting the code.

```java
/*int blockX = 125;
int blockY = 125;
int blockSz = 50;
int defaultBlockSpeed = 1;
int blockSpeed = 1;
boolean canMoveY = true;
boolean canMoveLeft = true;
boolean canMoveRight = true;
*/

//The 'final' keyword means that whatever value is assigned is constant, so the variable cannot be modified

//General Block Variables
final int NUM_BLK_ATTRIBS = 8;
final int BLK_DEFAULT_SZ = 50;
//Block Struct Indices
final int BLK_SZ = 0;
final int BLK_X = 1;
final int BLK_Y = 2;
final int BLK_DEFAULT_SPEED = 3;
final int BLK_SPEED = 4;
final int BLK_Y_STATE = 5;
final int BLK_LEFT_STATE = 6;
final int BLK_RIGHT_STATE = 7;
//Game Loop Block Counter
int ACTIVE_BLOCK = 0;
//Array of game blocks
int[][] blocks = new int[2][NUM_BLK_ATTRIBS];

//Function that creates formatted block data given spawn data
int[] spawn_block(int size, int xPos, int yPos, int defaultSpeed)
{
  int[] blockData = new int[8];
  //Set block dimensions
  blockData[BLK_SZ] = size;
  blockData[BLK_X] = xPos;
  blockData[BLK_Y] = yPos;
  //Set block's active speed to its default speed
  blockData[BLK_DEFAULT_SPEED] = defaultSpeed;
